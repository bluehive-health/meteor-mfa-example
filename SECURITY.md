# Security Policy

## Overview

The Meteor MFA Example is a demonstration application designed to showcase two-factor authentication implementation. While this is an example project, we take security seriously and appreciate reports of potential vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Features

This example application demonstrates:

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- **Secure password handling** with Meteor's accounts system
- **Session management** with proper authentication flows
- **Input validation** for authentication forms
- **QR code generation** for authenticator app setup

## Known Limitations

As this is a demonstration application:

- **Not production-ready** without additional security hardening
- **Default configurations** may not be suitable for production use
- **Test credentials** are created for demonstration purposes
- **No rate limiting** is implemented beyond Meteor's defaults

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do not** create a public issue
2. **Email** security reports to: [security@bluehive.health]
3. **Include** detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Provide** your assessment of the impact

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fixes (if any)
- Your contact information

## Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and assess the report
3. **Response**: We'll provide a timeline for fixes
4. **Resolution**: We'll notify you when the issue is resolved

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using this example as a reference:

### Production Deployment

- **Use HTTPS** in production environments
- **Configure security headers** (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- **Set up rate limiting** for authentication endpoints
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Regular security updates** for all dependencies

### Authentication

- **Enforce strong passwords** in production
- **Implement account lockouts** after failed attempts
- **Add backup codes** for 2FA recovery
- **Consider additional security factors** (device fingerprinting, etc.)

### Infrastructure

- **Secure database access** with proper authentication
- **Monitor for suspicious activity** in logs
- **Implement backup strategies** for critical data
- **Use secure deployment practices**

## Dependencies

This application relies on:

- **Meteor Framework**: Follow Meteor security guidelines
- **accounts-2fa Package**: Official Meteor package for 2FA
- **React**: Keep React and dependencies updated
- **Node.js**: Use supported Node.js versions

## Security Updates

- Monitor the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bluehive-health/meteor-mfa-example) for updates
- Check [Meteor security announcements](https://docs.meteor.com/guide/security.html)
- Subscribe to security advisories for used packages

## Development Security

When contributing to this project:

- **Never commit** sensitive information (passwords, keys, tokens)
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Follow secure coding practices**
- **Add security tests** for new features
- **Review security implications** of changes

## Disclaimer

This is a demonstration application intended for educational purposes. While we strive to follow security best practices, this code should not be used in production without thorough security review and additional hardening.
